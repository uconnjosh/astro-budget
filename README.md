# Astro-budget

### www.astrobudget.com


A [WIP] ember cli app designed to show the big picture when it comes to money.
Enter in simple monthly budget info (income and expenses) and see your
allowances (or free-to-spend) money broken down into how much money you
have per day, week, month, and year. Saving the record will persist your budget
information to the browser's datastore (via pouchDB).

Once you have your budget setup, you can track your spending by creating
a 'Month'. A month helps you keep track of your spending over a period of
30 days. The month shows/tracks how much spending money you have on a daily,
weekly, and monthly basis.
